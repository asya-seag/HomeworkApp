## Gardening app

## Project Overview

This Gardening App is a project developed as part of the Code First Girls +Masters Mobile App Development course. I implemented navigation structure with most of the app isolated behind authentification, divided login/register tab from the main navigation, practiced use of hooks, used News API during development but later switched to webview. Current Functionality pdf contains images of the working app.
